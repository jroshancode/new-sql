You said it returns names that end with a period (.) — like
"Ramu." or "Savio." — even though . isn’t a vowel.

-- ⚠️ Why This Happens

# In MySQL:

-- REGEXP uses POSIX regular expressions, not full PCRE syntax like in Python.

-- By default, the . (dot) in your data may still be matched because MySQL’s REGEXP doesn’t enforce strict case-sensitivity or ASCII-only behavior when collations are involved (especially utf8_general_ci or similar).

# In short:

-- Some collations make MySQL treat certain punctuation marks or accented characters as “equivalent” in a loose sense — so REGEXP '[aeiou]$' can match words ending with characters that aren’t pure letters, like "Ramu.".

# ✅ Correct (Strict) Fix — Use Binary Collation

-- To make regex case-sensitive and exact, force MySQL to use binary comparison:

SELECT `Product Name`, `Customer Name`
FROM train
-- WHERE `Customer Name` COLLATE utf8mb4_bin REGEXP '[aeiou]$';
WHERE `Product Name` REGEXP '[aeiou]$' 
  AND `Product Name` NOT REGEXP '\\.$';
